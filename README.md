InjectedCodeDemo
================

Demonstrates injecting code into a Windows Phone application for testing purposes.
This project creates a Windows Phone application, then injects code into a method
of that application which, when executed, opens a port and allows communication
with the injected code via a socket.

Requires the Windows Phone 8 SDK to work properly.
